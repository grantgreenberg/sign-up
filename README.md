# Sign-Up Form Webpage
Welcome to the Sign-Up Form Webpage project! This webpage provides a user-friendly sign-up experience with a sleek design divided into two containers: a captivating left section featuring a dynamic background image and a right section hosting the sign-up form. The project utilizes HTML for structure and CSS for styling, incorporating Google Fonts 'Quicksand' and 'Borel' to enhance the visual appeal. The form employs JavaScript-free validation patterns for first name, last name, email, phone number, and password to ensure data integrity. The left container showcases an SVG logo and credits the background image to photographer [Halie West](https://unsplash.com/@haliewestphoto).
